SIGCHI HTML/CSS Template
========================

An attempt at implementing the SIGCHI paper template in HTML & CSS.

Because it has to be less painful than doing it in Word...

Aimed primarily at Firefox (printing columns seems to be pretty screwed in Chrome)

Single-column view in browser, double-column in print
